JavaScript and Bootstrap

## What is the DOM

```iecst
- "Document Object Model"
- A tree of objects created by web browser, when a web page loads.
- The web browser uses the DOM to interpret the page and display it contents.

- Document
- Document Element <HTML>
- <head>, <title>
- <body>, <a>, <div>, <p>

- DOM
- Elements can have attributes and text content.
- Example:
- <a> element
- Attributes: href, target, id, alt
- href = "http://www.google.com"

- DOM
- We can change HTML elements, attributes, CSS styles, when different events are triggered.
- fe: a button is clicked or a page is loaded.

- Three methods of changing elements:
- By tag name (eg: <h1>)
- By id (eg: <p id="test">...</p>)
- By class name (eg: <li class="bullet1>)

- Javascript
- HTML & CSS - static programming language
- Javascript is Client-Side
- Communicates with Web Browser, not Web Server
- Javascript allows User-Web page interactivity

- cannot be forced onto users browser
- must be supported on clients browser
- most browser support javascript by default
- diff language from Java

- Rules for Javascript identifiers:
- names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs
- names must begin with a letter
- names are case sensitive (y and Y are diff)
- reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names

- var x = 10;
- var y = 10.5;
- var z = "John Smith"
- text values are knowns as strings

- Arithmetic Operators
- add +
- subtract -
- multiplication *
- division /
- modulus %
- increment ++
- decrement --

- javascript data types:
- numbers, strings, arrays, objects

- var age = 16; // number
- var lastname = "johnson"; // string
- var cars = ['acura', 'volvo', 'bmw']; // array
- var person = {firstname:'john', lasname:'smith', age:50, eyecolor:"blue"}; // object

- Comparison Operators
- equal to  ==
- equal value and equal type ===
- not equal !=
- not equal value or equal type !==
- greater than >
- less than <
- greater than or equal to  >=
- less than or equal to <==

- Boolean (truthy/falsy)

- real value = true

- For Loop
- just like C for loop
- for(count=3; count<=20; count++){
    document.write(count);
    document.write("<br/>");

}

- Javascript Events
- mouse clicks
- mouse overs
- mouse out
- key down
- document load
- ...
